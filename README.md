## Project Description
Pitch Hero is a gamified pitch trainer intended to motivate users of all musical levels to improve their relative pitch sense and singing skills, potentially to achieve perfect or relative pitch. In this web-app game, players must sing the appropriate notes in time in order to evade the obstacles and survive. As they get more practice, they can keep surpassing their previous high scores and even rank themselves globally on the leaderboard.

## User Manual
### Description
  Pitch Hero is a gamified pitch trainer intended to motivate users of all musical levels to improve their relative pitch sense and singing skills. The game is played in   the web browser and involves the user singing different pitches to dodge the incoming obstacles. If the player collides with an obstacle, their final score is displayed   and the game ends. Through practice, the player's pitch skills will improve and they can beat their previous high scores, placing them on the leaderboards for everyone     to see!
### Installing and running.
  Pitch Hero is a browser game thus no additional installation is required. The game can be found and run at https://pitch-guys.github.io/pitch-hero/.
### Playing the Game
  Press START and allow microphone access to start the game. The user can set the minimum and maximum pitch values for the game in their respective boxes. Changing the pitch of your voice will move the trumpet up and down, allowing you to navigate through the pipe gaps safely. The game can be paused (via the pause button) or reset (via the reset button) any time should the user need a break. The user can also change the game difficulty by clicking one of the game difficulty buttons (easy, normal, or hard). When the trumpet hits an obstacle, the game terminates and prompts the user to enter a username to represent their high score.

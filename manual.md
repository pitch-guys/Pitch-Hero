# User Manual
## Description
  Pitch Hero is a gamified pitch trainer intended to motivate users of all musical levels to improve their relative pitch sense and singing skills. The game is played in   the web browser and involves the user singing different pitches to dodge the incoming obstacles. If the player collides with an obstacle, the final score is displayed   and the game ends. Through practice, the player pitch skills will improve and they can beat their previous high scores, placing them on the leaderboards for everyone     to see!

## Description
Pitch Hero is a pitch training game application made to make learning to sing a little more fun. An adaptation of the classic game "Flappy Bird", this game consists of a trumpet sprite which you can move higher or lower based on the pitch of your voice. Maneuver your way through moving pipes to get a higher score and at the same time improve your ability at recognizing and signing at a specific pitch!
